# DoctorU's Shop

## Intro

This is a first pass at a commerce system running on node.

## Installation

1. Install Node and associated npm
1. Install MongoDB
1. from this directory, run `npm install`

## Startup
If you have enough CPU cycles, you can start up and run the shop from one line:

  cd ../..
  node nodejs/shop/control db:start shop
Will start a mongoDB instance and fork it.

## Errata
This is a work in progress. Please let me know (via github) if you have problems.

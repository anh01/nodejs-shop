-- Architectural Principles

    * System should be easy to deploy a small part 
        * Should be unneccessary to deploy the whole system
        * Complex client-service system
        * Services for:
            * Product
                * Inventory
                * Price
                * Category
            * Order
            * Address
            * Payment
            * Customer
            * Auth
            
            
            
             
        * Made up of small services
        * Changes should be made by deploying new revisions of APIs, then migrating clients over
